Intro: The simplest answer to all questions is: visit the open day on Saturday, and ask the staff. But we can answer some questions here too.

###Can we discuss the details about my prototype via the mail?
We're sorry, we can't do that via the mail, but you are welcome to visit us during our open day, every Saturday from 10 – 17.00 (except holiday periods).

###Can I hire a machine on weekdays?
Outside the open day it is not possible to hire machines on an hourly basis. If you wish, you can hire the complete Fab Lab for half a day or a complete day and invite your crew to make your prototype at our facilities. (link: http://waag.org/contact text: Contact) our Services department.

###How can I book a machine on the open day?
Go to the machines page to make a booking for a machine. You pay an hourly fee for each machine at our location. You will receive a refund if you document your work in the right way at Openthings.

###How do I check the availability of the machines?
Please check the online calendar of the machines at the booking pages.

###How do I know if I prepared the right files for the machines?
You can find information at the machine pages, including the specifications of the machines. If you are not sure, visit the open day and ask our staff.

###Help, I don't know how to use the machine!
Don’t worry, there will be someone of us helping you to start your job.

###Can I make series of my work?
No, for that purpose you will have to take your work to an industrial partner.

###Can I get a tour? Can I make a visit? Get a presentation?
No, we do not organize tours and presentations. You can just walk in during the open day.
