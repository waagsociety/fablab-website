    <p>I had to work for a client in making a roof construction that simulates a real roof of a castel in Switserland. The reason is to use it as a work model to play with the light for design solutions. </p>
<p>I had short time to plan and develop this model (5 working days), but Fablab was luckely in the summertime less full and I could book the CNC frees machine from one day to the other. </p>
<p>The wood used was 1cm dark playwood and I bought it in Schmit Houthandel (next to Fablab), they are more expensive but as I said... I had short time to plan and I had to find a place that would transport the wood to the CNC the same day. They did it for free.</p>
<p>Tips if you use this material in de CNC... don't make too little pieces too close to eachothers... they will spring from the plate while milling otherwise... This material needs also sandpapering after milling... time to take in consideration.</p>
