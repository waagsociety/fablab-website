    <p>The 'Spraakmakerstafel' is the result of a design challenge and assignment.<br>This challenge was given to second year technasium students of the Caland Lyceum in Amsterdam Nieuw-West by The Beach.</p>
<p>The students were challenged with designing a table that could be constructed from a single plate of wood, that could be easily assembled and dismantled for transport, did not need any glue, screws or nails, and most importantly, the table's design would invoke interaction and conversation.</p>
<p>The best concept was worked out with the help of the Beach and Fablab Amsterdam, and produced in the Fablab!</p>
<p><strong>How the table was designed</strong><br>The students came up with various designs and concepts.<br>A rigorous materialisation design was needed to get the initial idea to a producable table that would fit.<br>The students from the winning table helped the redesign and the production.</p>
<p><strong>Design notes<br></strong>The table used through tenon and mortise connections in most places, though effective the tolerances used were too tight to easily assemble and disassemble the table.<br>Wood: 18mm plywood Okum√©<br>Milling bit used: 5mm flathead milling bit<br>Tolerance: 0.05mm on each side. An 18x18mm tenon would have an 18.1x18.1mm mortise.</p>
<p>Different types of wood with different thickness and different millingbits will require different tolerances, a tolerance test could be useful beforehand next time!</p>
<p>The wood became terribly bent due to the climate differences from the shop to the FabLab. Because of this, parts could not be milled as precisely as should've been for the tight fit we assumed.</p>
<p>The pegs that hold together the parts of the table's legs deploy wooden rings with a hole in it. Friction would keep together the legs, but because of the tight tolerance and four layers of wood, the pegs didn't go through or come out easily. A better solution would be to simply block the pegs in place with a hole and a wedge of some sort.</p>
<p><strong>Gratitude</strong><br>Many thanks go out: to Alessandro who pulled through a long week of work and still found the energy and time to help out with the design and production of the table. To Bo, of whom I brutally borrowed the laptop to continue building on the 3D model of the table because my laptop crashed. To Rutger Gast, teacher at the Caland Lyceum, for being a cool dude and making the project a school assignment. To Cecillia and Emma for not losing their minds with 30+ kids running around the FabLab and generally being cool chicks. To Karen for helping with sorting out last minute near-disasters. To Alex, for being enthusiastic and helping out with giving the kids feedback, take it easy! To all others whom I forgot to thank, sorry, thank you anyway!</p>
