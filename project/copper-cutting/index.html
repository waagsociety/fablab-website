    <p>With this post, I am going to unveil new achievements with the vinyl cutter machine, and widen the playground to all copper cutting enthusiasts.</p>
<p>The main problem you will eventually come across while cutting copper is that the cut parts will lift from the support as soon as they are touched by the machine's blade, making it very likely to tangle during the process and ruin the rest of the design.</p>
<p>So, after few unsuccessful trials and consultation, we came up with the solution of using 2 layers of transfer paper tape just over the copper surface.</p>
<p>Settings will need to be unbelievably extreme, with very low speed and very high force.</p>
<p>Cutting this sandwich of layers at once will provide the right pressure for the copper, will prevent sliding and will make it easier to "peel it" from the back, ready to apply on the new support.</p>
<p>Now only part left it getting rid of the transfer tape: to help this last step I had previously weakened the glue of the transfer tape by just sticking it and removing it quickly from a (clean) smooth table, before applying it evenly on the copper piece.</p>
