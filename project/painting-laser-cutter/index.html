    <p>I've been thinking about the laser cutter and 3D printing for a while. How to use them in my work as an artist. I finally came up with quite a classical idea when I saw a woodcarved table in the museum. I will be making a serie of woman portraits made with different colour wood and partially painted with just regular oils. For me it's important that the materials I use can also be used to make paintings but I can also see them used to make lampshades for example so I will describe the materials most of all. </p>
<p>Yesterday I tested flexible veneer sheets that are called look' likes, (<a href="http://www.looklikesveneer.com" title="www.looklikesveneer.com">www.looklikesveneer.com</a>) and they come in large sheets (2.40 m x 1.20 m in a 1 mm thickness) made of wood. Very thin layers of wood coloured in different fashionable colours. Although the material is just 1 mm thick it's very strong and it doen't break because it is glued to paper. It is very flexible to both sides. </p>
<p>I made my drawing in inkscape and to cut the veneer I used power 100 and speed 3.5 because there is a slight difference in thickness of the different wood colours. A quicker speed did not cut all the different woods completely. </p>
